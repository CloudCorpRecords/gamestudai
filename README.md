   - Action nodes (movement, animations, sounds)
   - Logic nodes (conditions, loops, variables)
   - Math nodes (calculations, vectors, transformations)
   - Physics nodes (forces, constraints, raycasts)
   - Character Model Nodes (load, animate, control characters)

2. **Easy Connections**:
   - Connect nodes with visual wires
   - Color-coded connections for different data types
   - Auto-suggestion for compatible connections
   - Error checking and validation

3. **Custom Behaviors**:
   - Create reusable behavior scripts
   - Share scripts with the community
   - Nest scripts for complex functionality
   - AI suggestions for optimizing behaviors

## üéÆ Using GameStuAI Engine

### World Builder

1. **Terrain Editor**: Create landscapes with various terrain types and features.
2. **Object Placement**: Add objects to your world with precise control.
   - Control advanced physics properties like friction, bounciness, mass, and simulation type
   - Choose from various physics materials (metal, wood, rubber, ice, etc.)
   - Select different collision shapes for accurate physical behavior
3. **Environment Settings**: Adjust lighting, sky, and weather effects.

### Character Model Manager

Access the Character Model Manager from the sidebar to:

1. **Upload Models**: 
   - Support for GLB, GLTF, FBX, and OBJ formats
   - Add metadata and tags for organization

2. **Manage Model Library**:
   - Browse your collection of models
   - Search and filter by tags
   - Preview in real-time 3D viewer

3. **Add to Game World**:
   - Drag and drop models into your game scene
   - Configure position, rotation, and scale
   - Apply physics behaviors (walkable, interactive, physics-driven)

4. **Use in Visual Scripts**:
   - Connect character models to behaviors
   - Control animations and movement
   - Integrate with game events

### Physics System

Our physics system is inspired by Unreal Engine, providing:

1. **Material Properties**:
   - Predefined materials like metal, wood, rubber, concrete
   - Control friction, bounciness, and density
   - Custom material properties for unique behaviors

2. **Collision Shapes**:
   - Box, sphere, cylinder, capsule shapes
   - Convex hull for complex shapes
   - Compound shapes for multi-part objects

3. **Body Types**:
   - Static (immovable objects)
   - Dynamic (fully simulated physics)
   - Kinematic (user-controlled with physics response)
   - Simulated (character controllers with physics)

4. **Constraints**:
   - Hinges, point-to-point connections
   - Distance constraints
   - Springs and damping

5. **Debug Visualization**:
   - Real-time wireframe display of collision shapes
   - Physics properties displayed in the inspector

### Visual Scripting

In the Visual Scripting editor, you can:

1. **Character Model Nodes**:
   - **Load Model**: Loads a character model by ID
   - **Animate Model**: Plays animations on a character
   - **Move Character**: Moves a character to a target position
   - **Character Action**: Triggers predefined actions like idle, walk, run

2. **Creating Character Behaviors**:
   - Connect character model nodes with event nodes to trigger animations
   - Use logic nodes to create conditional behaviors
   - Build complex character AI with combinations of nodes
