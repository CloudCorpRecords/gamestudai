## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Easy Installation (Recommended)

#### For Mac/Linux Users:
1. Open Terminal in the project directory
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   sh start.sh
   ```

#### For Windows Users:
1. Double-click the `start.bat` file in the project folder
   
OR

1. Open Command Prompt in the project directory
2. Run:
   ```
   start.bat
   ```

That's it! The script will check your Node.js version, install all dependencies, and start the development server automatically.

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Install dependencies with legacy peer dependencies:
   ```
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìñ Using GameStuAI Engine

### Character Model Manager

1. **Accessing the Model Manager**:
   - Click on the "Character Models" tab in the top navigation bar

2. **Working with the Model Library**:
   - **Upload Models**: Click the "Upload Model" button to add 3D models
   - **Browse Models**: View all models in the library grid
   - **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar and tag filters to find models
   - **Select a Model**: Click on any model to view and edit it

3. **3D Model Preview**:
   - View the selected model in a 3D preview window
   - Orbit around the model to see it from all angles
   - Edit model properties (name, type, tags) by clicking the "Edit" button

4. **Adding Models to Your Game**:
   - Select a model from the library
   - Use the integration panel to set position, rotation, and scale
   - Select behaviors to apply to the character
   - Click "Add to Game World" to place the model in your game

5. **Adding Models to Visual Scripts**:
   - Select a model and click "Add to Script" to create a model node in the Visual Scripting editor
   - Connect the model node to other nodes to create character behaviors

### Visual Scripting with Character Models

1. **Character Model Nodes**:
   - **Load Model**: Loads a character model by ID
   - **Animate Model**: Plays animations on a character
   - **Move Character**: Moves a character to a target position
   - **Character Action**: Triggers predefined actions like idle, walk, run

2. **Creating Character Behaviors**:
   - Connect character model nodes with event nodes to trigger animations
   - Use logic nodes to create conditional behaviors
   - Build complex character AI with combinations of nodes

## üß© Architecture

GameStuAI Engine is built with modern web technologies:

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **Cannon.js**: Physics engine
- **ReactFlow**: Visual scripting system
- **OpenAI API**: AI integration for asset generation and assistance
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
