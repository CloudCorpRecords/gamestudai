# Help Button Component

The Help Button component provides instant access to documentation and help resources from anywhere in the GameStuAI Engine interface, making it easier for users to find answers to their questions without interrupting their workflow.

## Overview

The Help Button appears as a floating blue circular button with a question mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the interface. It's designed to be:

- Accessible from anywhere in the application
- Non-intrusive to your workflow
- Quick to provide relevant documentation
- Context-aware (when possible)

## Using the Help Button

### Accessing Help

To access the documentation:

1. Click the floating blue button with the question mark (?) icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen
2. The documentation panel will slide in from the right side of the screen
3. Browse the documentation to find the information you need
4. Click outside the documentation panel or the X button to close it

### Context-Sensitive Help

In many areas of GameStuAI Engine, the Help Button will provide context-sensitive documentation:

- In the Visual Scripting editor, it will show documentation about nodes and connections
- In the Character Model Manager, it will show information about model management
- In the Scene Editor, it will provide guidance on scene creation and object manipulation

To get context-sensitive help, simply click the Help Button while working in a specific area of the application.

## Documentation Panel Features

## Customizing the Help Button

You can customize the behavior of the Help Button in the Settings panel:

1. Go to Edit → Preferences → Interface
2. Find the "Help Button" section
3. Customize options such as:
   - Button position (bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left)
   - Button visibility (always visible, visible on hover, hide completely)
   - Documentation panel size (small, medium, large)
   - Default documentation section
   - Context-sensitive help (enable/disable)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For keyboard users, you can:

- Press `F1` to open the documentation panel

- Use `Tab` to navigate through documentation links
- Use `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F` (macOS) to search within the documentation panel

## Offline Documentation

The Help Button provides access to the online documentation by default. If you're working offline:

1. Download the offline documentation package from the GameStuAI website
2. Go to Edit → Preferences → Documentation
3. Set the documentation source to "Local" and select the downloaded documentation folder
4. The Help Button will now use the offline documentation

## Contributing to Documentation

If you find missing information or errors in the documentation:

1. Click the "Suggest Edit" link at the bottom of any documentation page
2. Fill out the form with your suggested changes
3. Submit the form to the GameStuAI documentation team
4. You'll be notified when your suggestion is reviewed

## Best Practices

- Use the Help Button when you're stuck rather than immediately asking on forums
- Check the context-sensitive help first, as it's most relevant to what you're currently doing
- Use the search function to quickly find specific topics
- Bookmark frequently used documentation pages for faster access
- Provide feedback on the documentation to help us improve it

## Troubleshooting

### Help Button Not Appearing

- Check if the Help Button is enabled in Edit → Preferences → Interface
- Ensure your screen resolution is high enough to display the button
- Try restarting GameStuAI Engine

### Documentation Not Loading

- Check your internet connection (for online documentation)
- Verify that offline documentation is properly installed (for offline mode)
- Clear the browser cache in Edit → Preferences → Documentation → Clear Cache

### Context-Sensitive Help Not Working

- Make sure context-sensitive help is enabled in preferences
- Some areas might not have specific context-sensitive documentation yet
- Report missing context-sensitive documentation through the feedback form
